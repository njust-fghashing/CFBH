Train
---
(1) Put the parameters of Resnet18 into the path ./petrained. This parameters can be download at PyTorch official linkï¼šhttps://download.pytorch.org/models/resnet18-f37072fd.pth. <br>

(2) Train the network, such as: python CFBH.py --dataset cub_bird --ratio 0.25 --num_parts 64 	 <br>
